# Microservice Design Documentation

## Project Overview
This documentation provides a detailed design for a high-performance microservice capable of handling large data volumes. The microservice exposes a RESTful API with two main endpoints for data ingestion and retrieval. 

The service is designed to maintain performance as data scales to millions or billions of records. The architecture ensures read/write operations are within 500ms, with a degradation tolerance of no more than 10% over time.

The microservice is built using TypeScript and Node.js, with MongoDB as the database for storing and querying data. We also use Redis for caching and queueing to improve performance.
The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed to Kubernetes for scalability and orchestration. We have set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

The estimated time to complete the project is 4 weeks, with a team of 5 software engineers working on its implementation. The project follows an agile development methodology with two-week sprints and regular code reviews. The tasks would be divided into backend development, testing, and deployment.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v20.17.0 - LTS)
- PNPM
- Docker
- Redis (for caching and queueing)
- Kubernetes
- Git
- MongoDB

### Steps to Set Up:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd microservice-project
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Set up the MongoDB database: 
   - For local development, start a MongoDB instance using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
     ```
4. Set up Redis:
   - For local development, start a Redis instance using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
     ```
5. Set up the environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the necessary variables:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
6. Start the microservice:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```
7. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build, Test, and Deploy Instructions
### Build:
- The microservice can be built using the following command:
  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```
### Test:
- Unit tests can be run using the following command:
  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```
### Deploy:
- The microservice can be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes:
  1. Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t microservice .
     ```
  2. Push the image to a container registry:
     ```bash
     docker push <registry-url>/microservice
     ```
  3. Deploy the microservice to Kubernetes using the manifest files provided.

## CI/CD Pipeline Explanation
The CI/CD pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Code Integration:
   - The pipeline triggers on every push to the main branch.
   - The code is checked out, dependencies are installed, and the application is built.
   - Linting and code quality checks are performed to ensure code consistency.
2. Automated Testing:
   - Unit tests are run to validate the core application functionality.
   - Test coverage reports are generated to track the quality of the tests.
3. Containerization and Deployment:
   - The Docker image is built and pushed to a container registry.
   - The microservice is deployed to Kubernetes using the manifest files.

## Architecture Overview
The microservice architecture consists of the following components:
- RESTful API endpoints for data ingestion and retrieval.
- MongoDB database for storing and querying data.
- Docker container for packaging the application.
- Kubernetes for orchestrating and scaling the microservice.
- GitHub Actions for automating the CI/CD pipeline.
- Unit tests for validating the core functionality of the application.
- Logging and monitoring for tracking performance and errors.

### Rationale
- TypeScript was chosen for its static typing and improved code quality, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- Node.js was selected for its scalability and performance characteristics, making it ideal for building server-side applications.
- MongoDB was chosen for its scalability and performance characteristics, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of JSON data.
- Docker and Kubernetes were selected for their containerization and orchestration capabilities, enabling easy deployment and scaling of the microservice.
- GitHub Actions was chosen for its integration with GitHub and ease of use for setting up CI/CD pipelines.
- Jest was selected as the testing framework for its simplicity and ease of use for writing unit tests.
- Sentry was chosen for error tracking to monitor application errors and ensure reliability.
- PNPM was chosen as the package manager for its faster installation and better disk space utilization compared to `npm`.

### API Request Handling
- The microservice exposes two main endpoints: POST `/data` for data ingestion and GET `/data` for data retrieval.
- The API request handling is done using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js.
- Input validation is performed using a middleware to ensure the data structure is correct before storing it in the database.
- The API responses are formatted as JSON objects with appropriate status codes and error messages.
- Error handling middleware is implemented to catch and log any errors that occur during request processing.
- The API is designed to be stateless and follows RESTful principles for resource management.
- Rate limiting and authentication can be implemented to secure the API and prevent abuse.
